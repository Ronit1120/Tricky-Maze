There is a maze in which you are lost in. The maze is represented by 2d grid. The location is shown by '*' and the only escape location is shown by '$'. You can can move to the left or right by one square on a single row, or move one square
up or down in a single column. However, some squares in the grid are forbidden. These are marked with the character ‘!’. Other squares are teleportation squares. Each of these are marked with a capital letter. If you are on a square with a letter, say ‘A’, you can teleport, 
in one move, to all other squares labeled with the letter ‘A’. Same goes for all of the other capital letters.  The output is the minimum amount of moves (if possible) to reach the end of the maze
